Version History:
0.1		Dec 14, 2012	Initial version. Basic init() function, delay() and
						delayMicroseconds(), basic GPIO functions, i.e.
						pinMode(), digitalWrite(), digitalRead().

0.2		Dec 15, 2012	Power-saving interrupt based delay() function that
						puts processor to sleep during a delay implemented.
						The improved delay function allows delays up to almost
						5 days length. Crude pulseIn() function implemented.

0.3		Dec 17, 2012	PWM output implemented with the analogWrite() function.
						Servo signal PWM mode added, and servoWrite() function
						created for interfacing. Much improved implementation
						of pulseIn() created using a timer instead of empirical
						timing.

0.4		Dec 18, 2012	Implement analogRead() and analog pin configuration.
						Added timer functions using WTIMER4 to track elapsed time.
						Broke off pin multiplexing and other global constant arrays
						into stellarino_pins.h for better organization. Delay
						functions grouped with timer functions in stellarino_timer.h
						Switched PDL commands to ROM versions to reduce binary size.

0.5		Dec 19, 2012	Implement basic FOSS UART library to eliminate dependence on
						incompatibly licensed UARTstdio library. Rename timer
						functions to millis() and micros() to better match Wiring.
						Modify timer functions to count one unit of time per timer
						tick instead of one per ten ticks. This increases the range
						of the timers ten-fold. Timers are now started automatically
						upon init() to better match Wiring, but the ability to reset
						the timers has been maintained. Fixed delayMicroseconds().
						Added example using the setup() and loop() structure of Wiring
						sketches.
